Most **“healthy routing”** studies center on pedestrians or transit. For private-car commuters in mainland China, routes differ in visual greenness, air/noise pollution, pavement smoothness, traffic-signal friction, and e-motor mixing—all of which shape stress and safety. With China’s rich map and traffic APIs *(Amap/Baidu)*, ubiquitous roadside AQ stations, growing e-motor fleets, and abundant dashcam data, we can build and test multi-objective driving routes that keep ETA nearly unchanged while optimizing health and comfort factors.
